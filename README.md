# OpenRail Project Template Repository

This repository is a template which can be used to create new repositories within the OpenRail Association. It contains the minimum required standard files to define governance and basic project information. Each project should then adapt them to their own needs within the guidelines defined by the OpenRail Association.

This README.md file is the description of the template repository. For a new repository you should replace it by a README.md tailored for your project.
